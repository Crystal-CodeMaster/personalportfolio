7. What This Means Going Forward
This experiment wasn’t just about making one teaser — it was about making a statement.

We’re entering an era where anyone with an idea and a laptop can potentially create cinematic visuals. That’s a profound shift. But it also raises urgent questions: Will these tools deepen our understanding of the past — or flatten it? Will they amplify marginalized voices — or overwrite them with AI-generated tropes? Will storytellers retain authorship — or outsource creative responsibility to the algorithm?

These are not abstract dilemmas. They are already happening.

That’s why we approached this project as a prototype — not just for a film, but for a practice. A methodology for AI-assisted historical storytelling that prioritizes ethics, emotion, and memory.

And that practice doesn’t stop here. We’re continuing to develop Minette for a larger screen adaptation. We’re building frameworks to support diaspora communities in reclaiming their own histories through accessible AI tools. We’re developing a book that charts these shifts and offers a vision for what ethical, innovative storytelling looks like in the age of machine intelligence.

At the core of it all is a belief: technology should be in service to memory, not the other way around.

8. Conclusion: Toward a New Kind of Creator
If this experiment proved anything, it’s that we need a new kind of creator in this moment — someone who can hold multiple truths at once:

Who can work with machines without losing sight of the human.

Who understands that history is not just content, but inheritance.

Who sees technology not as a shortcut, but as a new kind of canvas — one that requires as much responsibility as it does imagination.

This is the space I’m building toward. As a filmmaker, researcher, and migration specialist, my work is grounded in the idea that stories move people — across time, borders, and platforms. But those stories must be told with care.

If AI is the future of filmmaking, then the future needs storytellers who know where we’ve come from. Not just to represent the past, but to make sure we don’t lose ourselves in the speed of the present.

That’s why we did this. Not to go viral. Not to impress. But to build a bridge — between history and innovation, between art and ethics, between what’s possible and what’s right.

And that bridge starts here.
